# Common issues with the Discord client on Linux

## List of Discord's dependencies on most popular distros

### Discord's dependencies on Debian based distros (includes Ubuntu based distros which also includes Mint):

```
libc6, libasound2, libatomic1, libgconf-2-4, libnotify4, libnspr4, libnss3, libstdc++6, libxss1, libxtst6, libappindicator1, libc++1
```

### Discord's dependencies on Arch Linux:

```
glibc, alsa-lib, gcc-libs, gconf, libnotify, nspr, nss, libxss, libxtst, libc++ (libc++ is installed from the AUR)
```

### Discord's dependencies on Fedora:

```
libatomic, glibc, alsa-lib, GConf2, libnotify, nspr >= 4.13, nss >= 3.27, libstdc++, libX11 >= 1.6, libXtst >= 1.2, libappindicator, libcxx, libXScrnSaver
```

### Discord's dependencies on openSUSE:

```
libatomic1, glibc, alsa, gconf2, libnotify, mozilla-nspr >= 4.13, mozilla-nss >= 3.27, libstdc++6, libX11 >= 1.6, libXtst >= 1.2, libappindicator, libc++1, libXScrnSaver
```

## Crashes and issues caused by missing dependencies

### libc++1/libc++/libcxx

If Discord crashes before it loads, most times this is caused by the user missing `libc++1/libc++/libcxx`.  Having too old of a version of `libc++1/libc++/libcxx` can also cause Discord to crash before it loads.  A couple of examples of Discord's output in a terminal when this happens are shown below:

```
DiscordCanary[7645]: segfault at 0 ... error 4 in libc-2.23.so ...
```

```
exception_ptr not yet implemented
```

Steps to solve this issue:

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:

```
sudo apt-get install libc++1
```

Arch Linux:

[See the Arch package page for libc++ for install instructions](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/libc++/)

Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install libcxx
```

openSUSE:

```
sudo zypper install libc++1
```

CentOS/Others:

If the user is running a distribution such as CentOS which has too old of a version of libc++1/libc++/libcxx, they will not be able to run Discord without either adding an additional repository to update their libc++1/libc++/libcxx version or they can use the [AppImage builds of Discord](http://simonizor.net/discord) which contain all of the necessary dependencies for Discord to run (including an up to date libc++1/libc++/libcxx).

### libatomic1/libatomic

If a red banner shows at the top of the Discord client on Linux saying that the install is corrupt, this is almost always caused by the user missing `libatomic1/libatomic`.  Some users have also reported that voice chat does not work properly without `libatomic1/libatomic` installed.

Steps to solve this issue:

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

```
sudo apt-get install libatomic1
```

Arch Linux:

```
sudo pacman -S gcc-libs
```

Fedora/CentOS:

```
sudo dnf install libatomic
```

openSUSE:

```
sudo zypper install libatomic1
```

### Notification Daemons

If the user is not running a notification daemon (such as notify-osd, notification-daemon, dunst, etc), Discord will appear to freeze for a few seconds every time that the Discord client tries to send a desktop notification (when the user gets a mention, DM, etc).  This can be solved by either disabling notifications in Discord's settings or by installing a notification daemon.

Steps to solve this issue:

There are multiple notification daemons that the user may choose to install.  If a user is not running a notification daemon, it is usually because they are not running a Desktop Environment which would provide one for them.  Both `dunst` and `notify-osd` are lightweight notification daemons that are commonly installed without a Desktop Environment.  The examples below show how to install `notify-osd`

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

```
sudo apt-get install notify-osd
```

Arch Linux:

```
sudo pacman -S notify-osd
```

Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install notify-osd
```

openSUSE:

```
sudo zypper install notify-osd
```

## Other issues

### Cannot disable Discord launching on startup

Discord uses a setting that only works with GNOME based Desktop Environments, so any user who is running a different Desktop Environment (such as KDE Plasma, LXDE, LXQt, etc) will not be able to disable having Discord launch on startup after it has been enabled the first time.  To fix this, the user can just delete Discord's .desktop file in `~/.config/autostart`, but this issue will reappear if the user ever touches the setting within the client again.

### No input or output audio devices listed

Recently, Discord's voice chat has stopped working if the user does not have `pulseaudio` installed.  Users have reported that notification sounds work fine, but Discord does not detect any input or output devices for voice chat.  To fix this, the user can install `pulseaudio`.  As an alternative, the user ***may*** also be able to use `apulse`, but some users have reported that `apulse` does not work.
